How can a story-teller start to tell a story?

How can an audience or reader of a story begin to engage with the story being told?

What is happening, indeed what *has* happened, before the story is even told?

Whatever else may be going on in the composition or reception of a plot, the experience of it is grounded in the real world, the world of *action*, of *structures*, of *symbols* and of *temporality*. Narratives describe something recognisable by comparison with the real world, and a story’s world-like features are described in the plot (rather than deduced).¹

Paul Ricoeur argues that, if this is true, three things must exist for mimesis1, prefiguration, to function.

## Narrative Competence

Firstly, the composer or audience must have existing experience in order to recognise descriptions of world-like features; in other words, ‘if it is true that plot is an imitation of action, some preliminary competence is required: the capacity for identifying action in general by means of its *structural* features.’²

Secondly, a further level of competence is required: ‘an aptitude for identifying … the symbolic mediations of action.’³

And thirdly, the symbolic features are wrapped in temporal elements, ‘from which proceed more directly the very capacity of action to be narrated and perhaps the need to narrate it.’⁴

A competence in recognising and working with these three — the structural, the symbolic and the temporal — provides the basis for narrative competence, a necessary quality for narration.

Narrative competence is, of course, a dynamic, not static, quality: one does not ‘arrive’ at competence but rather continues to develop and extend one’s competency as one is persistently exposed to stories — stories of all kinds, narratives of all types.⁵ Ricoeur’s view is not limited to merely ‘literary’ stories here. Every form of story helps progress one’s narrative competence, from someone recounting a memory or relaying the story of their day at work, through newspaper accounts, movies, video games, social media posts, non-verbal stories, all the way through to the more orthodox form in published books. All exposure to narrative and narrativity develops one’s narrative competence.
