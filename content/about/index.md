This site is a thorough examination of figuration, Ricoeur's mimetic theory of narrative, and an exploration of practical applications of this thesis to real-world narrative studies.

It is based on work from my PhD in [Biblical Studies](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/religion/){target=_blank rel="noopener ugc nofollow"} at [Bristol University](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/){target=_blank rel="noopener ugc nofollow"}, [Narrative, Sin and Forgiveness: An Assessment of N T Wright's Narrative Criticism Through the Hermeneutics of Paul Ricoeur](https://pmt-eu.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44BU_LMS_DS001029670&context=L&vid=44BU_VU1&search_scope=default_scope&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US){target=_blank rel="noopener ugc nofollow"}, completed in 2017.

I write more about stories, writing, narratology and narrative figuration over on my personal website:
